Kouncil 1.7 is compatible with more versions of Kafka than the previous version of the application. Schema Registry, which is connected with the Kafka cluster, has also seen improvements.

## Kafka AWS MSK
Kouncil 1.7 allows you to connect Kafka hosted on a cloud solution from Amazon - Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK).

All you need is the appropriate configuration and connection URLs to the brokers on the Kafka cluster in the Kouncil configuration file.

## Schema Registry
In Kouncil 1.7, you can connect Schema Registry secured with SSL and/or basic authentication. You only need a proper cluster configuration that includes Schema Registry settings.

We will discuss both topics in more detail in upcoming articles.

## Miscellaneous
If you are interested in checking sample configurations, take a look at our documentation: [Advanced config - AWS MSK Kafka cluster](https://docs.kouncil.io/getting-started/deployment#advanced-config-amazon-msk-kafka-cluster) and [Advanced config - SSL Schema registry](https://docs.kouncil.io/getting-started/deployment#advanced-config-ssl-schema-registry), or [Advanced config - Schema registry SSL and BASIC Authentication](https://docs.kouncil.io/getting-started/deployment#advanced-config-schema-registry-ssl-and-basic-authentication).

After logging in, you will see an anonymous survey aimed at measuring the satisfaction of the application's users. We care about your feedback and would be very grateful if you could take a moment to fill it out.
