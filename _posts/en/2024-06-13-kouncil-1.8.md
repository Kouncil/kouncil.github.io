In the latest version of Kouncil 1.8, we have introduced several new features:
* topic and schema management 
* support for logical types in AVRO schemas 
* ability to [configure](https://docs.kouncil.io/getting-started/configuration/custom_context_path) the context path for Kouncil's user access 
* replacement of all text editors with the Monaco editor

## Topic management
Kouncil version 1.8 allows you to fully manage topics, from creating and editing to deleting them.
