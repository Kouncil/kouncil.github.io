Working on the latest version of Kouncil, we focused on improving the application security and added the possibility of safely connecting with Kafka brokers.

We discuss both issues in more detail below.

## Autentykacja
When you open the latest version of Kouncil, you will see a completely new start screen with a login function.
We have prepared 4 authentication options:
* In-Memory (with a predefined administrative user)
* Active Directory
* LDAP
* SSO (based on GitHub)

*Login screen for In-Memory, Active Directory and LDAP authentication*

*Login screen for SSO authentication*

## Broker authentication
With this new feature, you can secure your brokers with the SASL authentication mechanism. All you need to do is enter your broker login details when configuring your Kafka cluster in Kouncil, and Kouncil will authenticate when you attempt to connect.

## Effect
#### These changes make working with Kouncil even more secure.

## Miscellaneous
If you want to check out a sample configuration, refer to our documentation, [Authentication](https://docs.kouncil.io/getting-started/deployment#authentication) and [SASL Authentication](https://docs.kouncil.io/getting-started/deployment#advanced-config-sasl-authentication).

To explore the full range of Kouncil's capabilities, download the application from our [GitHub](https://github.com/consdata/kouncil).

We also encourage you to test and provide feedback via the [form](https://kouncil.io/contact-us/) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/consdata/kouncil).
