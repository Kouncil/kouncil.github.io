In this article, we will take a look at one of the cloud solutions - Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka, or Amazon MSK for short. We will go step by step from creating a Kafka cluster to connecting it to Kouncil. We will also deploy Kouncil in the cloud. In this article, we’ll demonstrate the most fundamental approach, beginning with an empty Centos. However, if you are already using AKS or Beanstalk, you can run Kouncil as a part of your architecture, as it comes down to running a Docker container.</summary>

If you are lucky, the system you have chosen will provide you with ready-made solutions to deal with emergencies but if you are unfortunate enough to have ended up working with Kafka you will have to find other ways to fix problems. In this blog post you will learn why there is no DLQ (Dead Letter Queue) in Kafka and how to handle a situation that calls for such a mechanism.</summary>

In some cases the events remain unchanged but the records on consecutive topics can also be modified, e.g. by adding data that is needed at further steps of the process. Event Tracking enables monitoring and visualizing the path of a given event or process by means of Kafka topics.</summary>

Kafka Companion is gone but this is good news because its place has been taken by Kouncil. The new version of the tool offers all the features its predecessor had, while introducing some new ones. In addition to the eye-catching redesign of the application, there are new features which will be described in detail in upcoming posts on this blog.</summary>
